 - This methodological approach is applied to all activities from the design of the product to customer support in an integrated way, using various methods, means and techniques in order to achieve production improvement, cost reduction, fulfillment of scheduled delivery dates, quality improvement and total flexibility in the manufacturing system. CIM requires all those associated with a company to involve totally in the process of product development and manufacture. In such a holistic approach, economic, social and human aspects have the same importance as technical aspects.

 - Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) encompasses the entire range of product development and manufacturing activities with all the functions being carried out with the help of dedicated software packages. The data required for various functions are passed from one application software to another in a seamless manner. For example, the product data is created during design. This data has to be transferred from the modeling software to manufacturing software without any loss of data. CIM uses a common database wherever feasible and communication technologies to integrate design, manufacturing and associated business functions that combine the automated segments of a factory or a manufacturing facility. CIM  reduces  the human component  of manufacturing and thereby relieves the process of its slow, expensive and errorprone component. CIM stands for a holistic and methodological approach to the activities of the manufacturing enterprise in order to achieve vast improvement in its performance.

 - CIM also encompasses the whole lot of enabling technologies including total quality  management, business process reengineering, concurrent engineering, workflow automation, enterprise resource planning and flexible manufacturing.

 - A distinct feature of manufacturing today is mass customization. This implies that though the products are manufactured in large quantities, products must incorporate An overview of CIM is presented in this chapter. A brief account of the evolution of CIM is included. The major functions carried out in a manufacturing plant are surveyed and the different levels of integration are identified. customerspecific changes to satisfy the diverse requirements of the customers. This requires extremely high flexibility in the manufacturing system. The challenge before the manufacturing engineers is illustrated in Fig.

# Figure: Challenges in Manufacturing

 - Manufacturing industries strive to reduce the cost of the product continuously to remain competitive in the face of global competition. In addition, there is the need to improve the quality and performance levels on a continuing basis. Another important requirement is on time delivery. In the context of global outsourcing and long supply chains cutting across several international borders, the task of continuously reducing delivery times is really an arduous task. CIM has several software tools to address the above needs. Manufacturing engineers are required to achieve the following objectives to be competitive in a global context.

  - Reduction in inventory
  - Lower the cost of the product
  - Reduce waste
  - Improve quality
  - Increase flexibility in manufacturing to achieve immediate and rapid response to:
  - Product changes
  - Production changes
  - Process change
  - Equipment change
  - Change of personnel

 - CIM technology is an enabling technology to meet the above challenges to the manufacturing. The advances in automation have enabled industries to develop islands of automation. Examples are flexible manufacturing cells, robotized work cells, flexible inspection cells etc. One of the objectives of CIM is to achieve the consolidation and integration of these islands of automation. This requires sharing of information among different applications or sections of a factory, accessing incompatible and heterogeneous data and devices. The ultimate objective is to meet the competition by improved customer satisfaction through reduction in cost, improvement in quality and reduction in product development time.

 - CIM makes full use of the capabilities of the digital computer to improve manufacturing. Two of them are:

 - I. Variable and Programmable automation

 - II. Real time optimization

 - The computer has the capability to accomplish the above for hardware components of manufacturing (the manufacturing machinery and equipment) and software component of manufacturing (the application software, the information flow, database and so on). The capabilities of the computer are thus exploited not only for the various bits and pieces of manufacturing activity but also for the entire system of manufacturing. Computers have the tremendous potential needed to integrate the entire manufacturing system and thereby evolve the computer integrated manufacturing system.

# NATURE AND ROLE OF THE ELEMENTS OF CIM SYSTEM

 - Nine major elements of a CIM system are in Fig. They are:

  - Marketing

  - Product Design

  - Planning

  - Purchase

  - Manufacturing Engineering

  - Factory Automation Hardware

  - Warehousing

  - Logistics and Supply Chain Management

  - Finance

  - Information Management


![u91](/CIM/Notes/src/u91.png)
# i. Marketing:
 60.0

# ii. Product Design:
 60.0

# iii. Planning:
 - The planning department takes the database established by the design department and enriches it with production data and information to produce a plan for the production of the product. Planning involves several subsystems dealing with materials, facility, process, tools, manpower, capacity, scheduling, outsourcing, assembly, inspection, logistics etc. In a CIM system, this planning process should be constrained by the production costs and by the production equipment and process capability, in order to generate and optimized plan.

# iv. Purchase:
 - The purchase departments is responsible for placing the purchase orders and follow up, ensure quality in the production process of the vendor, receive the items, arrange for inspection and supply the items to the stores or arrange timely delivery depending on the production schedule for eventual supply to manufacture and assembly.

# v. Manufacturing Engineering:
 - Manufacturing Engineering is the activity of carrying out the production of the product, involving further enrichment of the database with performance data and information about the production equipment and processes. In CIM, this requires activities like CNC programming, simulation and computer aided scheduling of the production activity. This should include online dynamic scheduling and control based on the real time performance of the equipment and processes to assure continuous production activity. Often, the need to meet fluctuating market demand requires the manufacturing system flexible and agile.

# vi. Factory Automation Hardware:
 - Factory automation equipment further enriches the database with equipment and process data, resident either in the operator or the equipment to carry out the production process. In CIM system this consists of computer controlled process machinery such as CNC machine tools, flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), Computer controlled robots, material handling systems, computer controlled assembly systems, flexibly automated inspection systems and so on.

# vii. Warehousing:
 - Warehousing is the function involving storage and retrieval of raw materials, components, finished goods as well as shipment of items. In today’s complex outsourcing scenario and the need for just-in-time supply of components and subsystems, logistics and supply chain management assume great importance.

# viii. Finance:
 - Finance deals with the resources pertaining to money. Planning of investment, working capital, and cash flow control, realization of receipts, accounting and allocation of funds are the major tasks of the finance departments.


![u91](/CIM/Notes/src/u91.png)

# ix. Information Management:
 - Information Management is perhaps one of the crucial tasks in CIM. This involves master production scheduling, database management, communication, manufacturing systems integration and management information systems.

# DATABASE REQUIREMENTS OF CIM:

 - A major challenge facing the implementation of CIM is to establish the type of data needed to bridge the mechanical design and manufacturing functions. Following is the list of varied tasks one might expect to accomplish in a CIM environment.

 - i. Designing assemblies and performing tolerance analysis on those assemblies.

 - ii. Preparing production drawings of assemblies, individual parts, tooling, fixtures and other manufacturing facilities.

 - iii. Creating analytical models of parts for structural, kinematical and thermal analysis (FEM, MeM etc).

 - iv. Calculating weights, volumes, centers of gravity and other mass properties and costs of manufacturing (cost estimation).

 - v. Classifying existing parts according to shape, function, and the process by which they are manufactured and retrieving these parts from the parts library on demand (Group technology and coding).

 - vi. Preparing part lists and bill of materials (BOM).

 - vii. Preparing process plans for individual part manufacture and assembly (Variant or Generative).

 - viii. Programming CNC machines for processing complete parts (CAM).

 - ix. Designing work cells and programming the movement of components in those cells using work handling devices like robots, conveyors, AGV’s/ RGV’s, etc. (Cellular manufacture).

 - x. Controlling engineering changes and maintaining associativity between design and manufacturing (PDM, VPDM, concurrent associativity etc).

 - xi.  Preparing programs to handle components or manipulate production equipment (like welding torches or robots).

 - xii. Preparing inspection programs including programs for CNC co-ordinate measuring machines [CNC CMM’s].

 - The exchange of graphic information has been advanced with increasing acceptance of Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) and STEP.

 - There are several classifications of data.

# i. Physical data:
 - These are data stored in the computer’s storage device. The volume of data required by a manufacturing company is so large that secondary storage devices such as hard discs, tapes, CD-ROMs, and other digital storage devices of several gigabyte capacities will be used.

# ii. Logical data:
 - This indicates how a user views the physical data. The distinction between the physical data and the corresponding logical view is that the user conceptualizes certain meaningful relationships among the physical data elements. For example, we may have a set of items and quantities recorded in files. The logical view or interpretation of these sets of data can be that the items represent components available in stores and that the quantities recorded correspond to their inventory.

# iii. Data independence:
 - Database management systems (DBMS) are used by the users to manage the physical data. DBMS makes a distinction between the two namely, the user and the physical data. Changes in the organization of physical data and or in the storage device parameters are absorbed by DBMS and therefore do not affect the user or more accurately, the application program. This flexibility is absent in the traditional file systems.

# OBJECTIVES OF DATABASE

 - A database serves the following objectives:

  - Reduce or eliminate redundant data.

  - Integrate existing data

  - Provide security

  - Share data among users

  - Incorporate changes quickly and effectively

  - Exercise effective control over data

  - Simplify the method of using data

  - Reduce the cost of storage and retrieval of data

  - Improve accuracy and integrity of data

# File processing system

 - A file processing system helps people keep track of files as they move throughout the various departments of a business. The purpose of this sort of system is to keep things organized, generally in alphabetical, numerical or chronological order. Companies that have effective file processing systems have ways to find those files in an orderly manner, rather than having staff members rifling through papers in order to find what they are looking for.

 - Whether a company uses paper files, cloud storage or a combination, keeping a consistent system in place is vital for the efficient handling of requests for information. Many companies have gone to a paperless environment in which files end up in hard drives, cloud storage or other places. Just as with a traditional filing cabinet, though, it is just as important to keep track of all files in a shared or personal drive. Most storage applications make it simple to set up and name file folders so that those in charge of storing data can put the right file in the right folder. Even without the sound of the drawers rolling open and the cold metal sensation of filing cabinets, it is still possible to keep files properly organized.

 - In a daily life, we come across various needs to store data. It can be maintaining daily household bills, bank account details, salary details, payment details, student information, student reports, books in the library etc. How it will be recorded at one place, so that we can get it back when required? It should be recorded in such a way that

 1. Should be able to get the data any point in time latter

 2. Should be able to add details to it whenever required

 3. Should be able to modify stored information, as needed

 4. Should also be able to delete them

 - In traditional approach, before to computer, all informations were stored in papers. When we need information, we used to search through the papers. If we know particular date or category of information we are searching, we go to that particular session in the papers. When we want update or delete some data, we search for it and modify them or strike off them. If the data is limited, then all these tasks are easy. Imagine library information or information about a student in School, or baking system! How do we search for single required data in papers? It is a never ending task! Yes, Computers solved our problems.

 - When computers came, all these jobs become easy. But initial days, these records were stored in the form of files. The way we stored in files is similar to papers, in the form of flat files – to be simpler, in notepad. Yes, the informations where all in the notepads with each fields of information separated by space, tab comma, semicolon or any other symbol. All the files were grouped based on their categories; file used to have only related informations and each file is named properly. As we can see in the above sample file has Student information. Student files for each class were bundled inside different folders to identify it quickly.

 - Now, if we want to see a specific Student detail from a file, what do we do? We know which file will have the data, we open that file and search for his details. Fine, here we see the files; we can open it and search for it. But imagine we want to display student details in a UI. Now how will we open a file, read or update it? There different programs like C, C++, COBOL etc which helps to do this task. Using these programming languages, we can search for files, open them, search for the data inside them, and go to specific line in the file, add/update/delete specific information.

 - File Organization and relation analysis:

 - It is used to determine an efficient file organization for each base relation. For example, if we want to retrieve student records in alphabetical order of name, sorting the file by student name is a good file organization. However, if we want to retrieve all students whose marks is in a certain range, a file ordered by student name would not be a good file organization. Some file organizations are efficient for bulk loading data into the database but inefficient for retrieve and other activities.

 - The objective of this selection is to choose an optimal file organization for each relation.

# Types of File Organization

 - In order to make effective selection of file organizations and indexes, here we present the details different types of file Organization. These are:

  - Heap File Organization

  - Hash File Organization

  - Indexed Sequential Access Methods (ISAM) File Organization

  - B+- tree File Organization

  - Cluster File Organization

# Heap (unordered) File Organization

 - An unordered file, sometimes called a heap file, is the simplest type of file organization.

 - Records are placed in file in the same order as they are inserted. A new record is inserted in the last page of the file; if there is insufficient space in the last page, a new page is added to the file. This makes insertion very efficient. However, as a heap file has no particular ordering with respect to field values, a linear search must be performed to access a record. A linear search involves reading pages from the file until the required is found. This makes retrievals from heap files that have more than a few pages relatively slow, unless the retrieval involves a large proportion of the records in the file.

 - To delete a record, the required page first has to be retrieved, the record marked as deleted, and the page written back to disk. The space with deleted records is not reused. Consequently, performance progressively deteriorates as deletion occurs. This means that heap files have to be periodically reorganized by the Database Administrator (DBA) to reclaim the unused space of deleted records.

 - Heap files are one of the best organizations for bulk loading data into a table, as records are inserted at the end of the sequence; there is no overhead of calculating what page the record should go on.

# Pros of Heap storage

 - Heap is a good storage structure in the following situations:

 - When data is being bulk-loaded into the relation.

 - The relation is only a few pages long. In this case, the time to locate any tuple is Short, even if the entire relation has been searched serially.

 - When every tuple in the relation has to be retrieved (in any order) every time the relation is accessed. For example, retrieve the name of all the students.

# Cons of Heap storage

 - Heap files are inappropriate when only selected tuples of a relation are to be accessed.

# Hash File Organization

 - In a hash file, records are not stored sequentially in a file instead a hash function is used to calculate the address of the page in which the record is to be stored.

 - The field on which hash function is calculated is called as Hash field and if that field acts as the key of the relation then it is called as Hash key. Records are randomly distributed in the file so it is also called as Random or Direct files. Commonly some arithmetic function is applied to the hash field so that records will be evenly distributed throughout the file.

# Pros of Hash file organization

 - Hash is a good storage structure in the following situations:

 - When tuples are retrieve based on an exact match on the hash field value, particularly if the access order is random. For example, if the STUDENT relation is hashed on Name then retrieval of the tuple with Name equal to Rahat Bhatia is efficient.

# Cons of Hash file organization

 - Hash is not a good storage structure in the following situations:

 - When tuples are retrieved based on a range of values for the hash field. For example, retrieve all students whose name begins with the R.

 - When tuples are retrieved based on a range of values for the hash field. For example, if STUDENT relation has hash filed Roll Number and the query is to retrieve all students with roll numbers in the range of 3000-5000.

 - When tuples re retrieved based on a field other than the hash field. For example, if the STUDENT relation is hashed on Roll Number, then hashing cannot be used to search for a tuple based on the Class attribute.

 - When tuples are retrieved based on only part of the hash field. For example, if the STUDENT relation is hashed on Roll Number and Class, then hashing cannot be used to search for a tuple based on the class attribute alone.

 - When the hash field frequently updated. When a hash field updated, the DBMS must deleted the entire tuple and possible relocate it to a new address (if the has function results in a new address). Thus, frequent updating of the hash field impacts performance.

# Secondary indexes

 - Secondary indexes provide a mechanism for specifying a...'1additional key for a base relation that can be used to retrieve data more efficiently. For example, the STUDENT relation may be hashed on the Name the primary index. However, there may be frequent access to this relation based on the Roll Number attribute. In this case, we may decide to add Roll Number as a secondary index.

 - There is an overhead involved in the maintenance and use of secondary indexes that has to be balanced against the performance improvement gained when retrieving data. This overhead includes:

  - adding an index record to every secondary index whenever a tuple is inserted into the relation;

  - updating a secondary index when the corresponding tuple in the relation is updated;

  - The increase in disk space needed to store the secondary index;

  - Possible performance degradation during query optimization, as the query optimizer may consider all secondary indexes before selecting an optimal execution strategy.

# Indexes Sequential Access Method (ISAM)

 - In an ISAM system, data is organized into records which are composed of fixed length fields. Records are stored sequentially. A secondary set of hash tables known as indexes contain pointers into the tables, allowing individual records to be retrieved without having to search the entire data set.

 - It is a data structure that allows the DBMS to locate particular records in a file more quickly and thereby speed response to user queries. An index in a database is similar to an index in a book. It is an auxiliary structure associated with a file that can be referred to when searching for an item of information, just like searching the index of a book, in which we look up a keyword to get a list of one or more pages the keyword appears on. An index obviates the need to scan sequentially through the file each time we want to find the item. In the case of database indexes, the required item will be one or more records in a file. As in the book index analogy, the index is ordered, and each index entry contains the item required and one or more locations (record identifiers) where the item can be found.

 - While indexes are not strictly necessary to use the DBMS, they can have a significant impact on performance. As with the book index, we could find the desired keyword by looking through the entire book, but this would be tedious and time-consuming. Having an index at the back of the book on alphabetical order to keYW0fd allows us to go directly to the page or pages we want.

 - An index structure is associated with a particular search key and contains record consisting of the key value and the address of the logical record in the file contains records consisting of the key value of the address of the logical record in the file containing the key value. The file containing the logical records is called the data file and the file containing the index records is called the index file. The value in the index file are ordered according to the indexing field, which is usually based on a single attribute.

 - A sorted data file with a primary index is called an indexed sequential file. This structure is a compromise between a purely sequential file and a purely random file, in that records can be processed sequentially or individually accessed using a search key value that accesses the record via the index. An indexed sequential file is a more versatile structure, which normally has.

  - A primary storage area;

  - A separate index or indexes;

  - An overflow area.

# When to use

 - ISAM is a more versatile storage structure than hash and it proved better when retrievals are based on exact key match, pattern matching, range of values, and part key specification.

# When not to use

 - However, the ISAM index is static, created when the file is created. Thus, the performance of an ISAM file deteriorates as the relation is updated. Updates also cause an ISAM file to lose the access key sequence, so that retrievals in order of the access key will become slower. These two problems are overcome by the B+-tree file organization. However, unlike B+- tree, concurrent access to the index can be easily managed because the index is static.

# B+-tree

 - A B+-tree is a data structure to store vast amounts of information. Typically B+-trees are used to store amounts of data that will not fit in main system memory. To do this, secondary storage (usually disk) is used to store the leaf nodes of the tree. Only the internal nodes of the tree are stored in computer memory. In a B+-tree the leaf nodes are the only ones that actually store data items. All other nodes are called index nodes or i-nodes and simply store guide values which allow us to traverse the tree structure from the root down and arrive at the leaf node containing the data item we seek as shown in figure. Because disk I/O is very slow in comparison to memory access these leaf nodes store more than one data item each.


![u93](/CIM/Notes/src/u93.png)

# Pros of B+-tree

 - Again, B+-tree is a more versatile storage structure than hashing. It supports retrievals based on exact key match, pattern matching, range of values, and part key specification. The B+-tree index is dynamic, growing as the relation grows. Thus, unlike ISAM, the performance of a B+-tree file does not deteriorate as the relation is updated. The B+-tree also maintains the order of the access key even' when the file is updated, so retrieval of tuples in the order of the access key is more efficient than ISAM.

# Cons of B+-tree

 - However, if the relation is not frequently updated, the ISAM structure may be more efficient as it has one less level of index than the B+-tree, whose leaf nodes contain pointers to the actual tuples rather than the tuples themselves.

# Clustered tables

 - Some DBMSs, such as Oracle, support clustered and non-clustered tables. Clusters are group of one or more tables physically stored together because they share common columns and are often used together. With related records being physically stored together, disk access time is improved. The related columns of the table in a cluster are called the cluster key. The cluster key is stored only once, and so clusters store a set of tables more efficiently than if the tables were stored individually.

 - Let us consider a case of emp and dept tables whose instances are shown in table. Both the tables have deptno as a common column. In Oracle these tables may be clustered together as shown in figure with deptno as a cluster key which is stored only once to improve the efficiency of the system.


![u94](/CIM/Notes/src/u94.png)


![u95](/CIM/Notes/src/u95.png)

 - Illustrates how the EMP and Dept tables would be stored if we clustered the tables based on the column Deptno. When these two tables are clustered, each unique Deptno value is stored only once, in the cluster key. To each Deptno value are attached the column from both these tables.

 - The choice of whether to use a clustered or non-clustered table depends on the analysis of the transactions undertaken previously, but the choice can have an impact on performance.Oracle supports two types of clusters: indexed clusters and hash clusters.

# Indexed Clusters

 - In an index cluster, records with the same cluster key are stored together. Oracle suggests using indexed clusters when:

  - Queries retrieve records over a range of cluster key value;

  - Clustered tables may grow unpredictable.

 - Cluster can improve performance of retrieval, depending on the data distribution and what SQL operations are most often performed on the data. In particular, tables that are joined in a query benefit from the use of clusters because the records common to the joined tables are retrieved with the same I/O operation.

# Hash Clusters

 - Hash clusters also cluster table data in a manner similar to index clusters. However, a record is stored in a hash cluster based on the result of applying a hash function to the record's cluster key value. All records with the same hash key value are stored together on disk.

  - The choice of whether to use a clustered or non-clustered table depends on the analysis of the transactions undertaken previously, but the choice can have an impacton performance

# Guidelines for the use of Cluster tables

 - The following guidelines may be helpful when deciding about the cluster tables:

  - Consider clustering tables when tables are often accessed in join statements.

  - Do not cluster tables if they are joined only occasionally or their common column values are modified frequently. (Modifying a row's cluster key value takes longer than modifying the value in an unclustered table, because Oracle may have to migrate the modified row to another block to maintain the cluster.)

  - Do not cluster table if a full search of one of the tables is often required. (A full search of a clustered table can take longer than a full search of an unclustered table. Oracle is likely to read more blocks because the tables are stored together.)

  - Consider clustering tables involved in a one-to-many (1: M) relationship if a row is often selected from the parent table and then the corresponding rows from the child table. (Child rows are stored in the same data block(s) as the parent row, so they are likely to be in memory when selected, requiring Oracle to perform less I/O.)

  - Do not cluster tables of the data from all tables with the same cluster key value exceeds more than one or two Oracle blocks. (To access a row in a clustered table. Oracle reads all blocks containing rows with that value. If these rows occupy multiple blocks, accessing a single row could require more reads than accessing the same row in an unclustered table.)

 - Decision Support Systems (DSS) are a specific class of computerized information system that supports business and organizational decision-making activities. A properly designed Decision Support System is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

 - Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present would be:

  - Accessing all of your current information assets, including legacy and relational data sources, cubes, data warehouses, and data marts

  - Comparative sales figures between one week and the next

  - Projected revenue figures based on new product sales assumptions

  - The consequences of different decision alternatives, given past experience in a context that is described

 - Information Builders' Web FOCUS reporting software is ideally suited for building decision support systems due to its wide reach of data, interactive facilities, ad hoc reporting capabilities, quick development times, and simple Web-based deployment.

 - Information Builders and i Way Software Professional Services specialize in building custom-tailored Web decision support systems.

# CNC Milling: Introduction to cutting tools


![u98](/CIM/Notes/src/u98.png)

 - Cutting tools come in a range of sizes, materials, and geometry types.

 - It is generally more efficient to use a combination of different tool paths and tools to achieve a detailed model rather than assuming that a small tool with a smaller step over is the only way. Often, a larger tool can achieve better finish results. In end milling, the cutter generally rotates on an axis vertical to the work piece. Cutting teeth are located on both the end face of the cutter and the periphery of the cutter body. A ball nose end mill, also known as a spherical end mill or ball end mill, has a semi sphere at the tool end. Ball nose end mills are used on work pieces with complex surfaces. Choosing flat end mill vs. a ball end mill will determine the characteristics of the tooling marks (or lack thereof) on your model. Most jobs will benefit from strategic use of multiple size and shape tools for milling different features. End Mills are often used for roughing and 2D cutting and V-Bit and Ball Nose cutters are often used for finishing operations.


![u99](/CIM/Notes/src/u99.png)

# End geometry
 - There are up-cut, down-cut, compression cut end mills with varying numbers of flutes. End mills are intended to cut horizontally.

 - Up-cut, down-cut and compression cut determine the way the chips (cut material) are ejected and the smoothness of the surface. With an up-cut end mill, the chips will be ejected upward and the bottom of the material will be smooth. The down-cut end mill is the reverse by punching the chips downward and the top of the material is smooth. The compression end mill creates a smooth surface on top and bottom, which is perfect for pre-laminated woods.

 - End mills come in a variety of shapes. The most common are flat end mills and ball end mills. Flat end mills will cut flat areas with no scallops. However, they leave a terrace-like scallop on non-flat surfaces. Ball end mills will leave smaller scallops for the same stepover value on sloped surfaces, but they will also leave scallops on flat areas.

 - Models can be tooled with a combination of flat and ball end mills. If only one tool will be used for all surfaces a ball end geometry will give a more consistent overall feel and smooth result.

 - Flat end mills can be Center Cutting and Non Center Cutting: Center cutting square endmills are essential for plunge milling. Non-center cutting mills are used only for side milling.


![u100](/CIM/Notes/src/u100.png)

 - When choosing a ball end mill always chooses the largest size available. For the same stepover, a larger tool will leave smaller scallops, thus giving a smoother result. For a generally smooth model with some areas of fine detail, a large tool should be used for the overall job and a smaller tool should be used only to clean out detailed areas.

 - Larger tools cut more cleanly, have larger clearance, and stay sharp longer. The velocity of the cutting edge on a larger tool is higher for the same spindle speed.


![u101](/CIM/Notes/src/u101.png)

# Stepover

 - Stepover is the distance the tool moves over between subsequent passes.

 - The stepover value (along with tool size) will determine whether the model has a smooth finish, or tooling marks are visible. It will also directly impact cutting time. Models with a smaller stepover take longer to cut.


![u102](/CIM/Notes/src/u102.png)

# Stepdown

 - The length of the cutting area within the tool determines how deep the material can be cut in one operation –this is called the maximum stepdown. This stepdown value will only be used to its maximum when the material that is being cut is soft; for harder materials a smaller value is often required, setting the toolpaths to mill away layers of materials in separate passes.

# Flute geometry

 - While the number, direction and type of flutes that a cutting tool has can vary widely, the tools most commonly used have two flutes and are up-cut spirals.

 - Some projects may benefit from other types of flute geometry. Contour cutting MDF or plywood sheets would benefit from down-cut spirals as the tool would push the material against the CNC machine table as it cuts rather than lift it.


![u103](/CIM/Notes/src/u103.png)

# Number of Flutes

 - Single Flute - Allows for larger chiploads in softer materials

 - Double Flute - Allows for better part finish in harder materials

 - Multiple Flutes - Allows for an even better part finish in harder materials

 - As the number of cutting edges increases, your feed rate should increase to prevent burning and premature tool dulling. More flutes reduce chip load and improves surface finish if feed rate remains the same. The most common flute numbers for general milling operations are two (better space for chip ejection) and four (better surface finish).

# Examples of applications using end mills:


![u104](/CIM/Notes/src/u104.png)

# Tool Materials

 - horizontal
# Material:
 - end mills are made either out of cobalt steel alloys (known as high speed steel, or HSS), or from tungsten carbide in a cobalt lattice (colloquially shortened to carbide). The latter option is considerably harder, more rigid, and more resistant. Carbide tools can be run at speeds 2 to 2.5 times faster than HSS tools. When using carbide tools ensure that your machine tool is rigid with a solid spindle and that holders have little or no runout. Due to the brittle nature of carbide and the speeds at which carbide tools are typically run, rigidity is critical to prevent tool breakage.

 - horizontal
# Coatings:
 - carbide cutters may be further coated with ceramics such as titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN, aka AlTiN), titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), and so on. Of these, the bluish-gray TiAlN coating is most common one, and by the virtue of reducing friction and improving hardness, it boosts the speed of metal cutting by up to 20%. It extends tool life.

# Angle plate

 - An angle plate is a work holding device used as a fixture in metalworking.

 - The angle plate is made from high quality material (generally spheroidal cast iron) that has been stabilized to prevent further movement or distortion. Slotted holes or T bolt slots are machined into the surfaces to enable the secure attachment or clamping of work pieces to the plate, and also of the plate to the worktable.

 - Angle plates also may be used to hold the work piece square to the table during marking out operations.

 - Adjustable angle plates are also available for work pieces that need to be inclined, usually towards a milling cutter.

 - Angle plates are used to measure and hold various work piece whilst being worked upon.

# Work Holding Devices

 - Work holding is the generic term for any device used to firmly hold your work piece while machining it. There are two components to work holding:

 - - The actual work holding device, such as a milling vise.

 - - The method of locating and securing that work holding device to your machine. This includes the ubiquitous T-Slots but goes on to include modular fixture plates, 4th axis solutions, and much more.

 - We'll go through the various methods of locating the work holding devices and then follow up with a description of your choices for work holding devices.

 - Positioning for Work holding Devices

# T-Slots


![u109](/CIM/Notes/src/u109.png)

 - T-Slots are the most common method of positioning and holding down your work holding solution...

 - T-Slots are by far the most common way of positioning and holding down your Work holding solution. They are simple, robust, and they work. To attach something to a T-Slotted table, use T-Slot nuts and suitable studs or other fasteners that fit the nuts:


![u110](/CIM/Notes/src/u110.png)

# T-Slot Nuts

 - While they are common, they have some disadvantages relative to other solutions. Aside from the fact that T-Slots can collect chips and other debris, their biggest disadvantage is that it's hard to get your vise or other Work holding fixture back onto the table in exactly the same place and orientation. This can result in extra work every time a machine needs to be set up with new workholding for a new job. Over time, the cost of that inefficiency can be quite large.

 - Just imagine, what if instead of having a tool changer and a tool table you had to dial in each tool every time it was used? Wouldn't that be a huge productivity block in your machining workflow? Well, setup time can be a big productivity block too, and T-Slots are not helpful for that.

 - There are some solutions that've been tried to make them a little better:

# Truing the Slots

 - We can check the T-Slots of machine to make sure the run parallel to axis motion by sweeping them with a Dial Test Indicator (DTI). If they don't, we can mill them true. A lot of folks hate the idea of intentionally milling their table, but if the T-Slots aren't true and you need them to be, it's hard to see what choice you have. But there is a choice that involves using something other than T-Slots as we will see shortly.

# Keyed Vises and Fixtures

 - If your T-Slots are true, you can install keys on the bottom of vises or fixture plates that line up with the T-Slots. You can also install keys in the T-Slots that line up the edge of a plate or vise base. Doing so can save you quite a lot of time tramming vises and such, and it isn't hard to do, so it is definitely worth considering.

 - The trouble is, these kinds of solutions will help with one dimension (typically the short dimension of the table is the Y dimension and is aligned perpendicular to the slots), but we still have the problem of positioning along the axis of the T-Slot.

 - Fortunately, there is a better way in the form of Fixture Sub-Plates (also called Tooling Plates).

 - Fixture Sub-Plates, Tooling Plates, and Modular Fixturing

 - Fixture Sub-Plates (also called Tooling Plates) are plates that are installed on top of a T-Slot table to provide a new way to position and secure Work holding. A typical Tooling Plate looks like this:


![u111](/CIM/Notes/src/u111.png)

# A typical Tooling Plate

 - Tooling Plates typically use a grid of holes that alternate between holes for precision dowel pins for positioning and threaded holes for fasteners. If this grid is precisely positioning (or even if it isn't and the positions are precisely known) you have a very repeatable way to install Workholding on the plate. The dowel pins provide precision location that is repeatable to perhaps half a thousandth. Imagine being able to drop a vise mounted on its own fixture plate with dowel pins and fastener holes onto a Tooling Plate and have it be repeatable to half thousandth. If all your fixtures can drop onto the Tooling Plate you can change the machine over to a new Workholding configuration very quickly indeed. The savings in time adds up to pay off the cost of such a system very quickly.

 - With an air ratchet in hand, a vise can be installed on one of these plates within a minute or two. A CNC Machine can be reconfigured in 5 or 10 minutes for a completely different job. And the skills required of the machine operators, as well as the potential for mistakes, are greatly reduced if the fixtures don't have to be carefully dialed in each time. There are advantages for the creation of modular g-code too, because it can rely on the positioning grid of the Tooling Plate.

 - If accuracy of more than half a thousandth is required, it is often better to use probing together with selected g-code parameterization to correct for the remaining error. You could try to dial things in more precisely by hand, but a probing solution can rely on things being nearly right to determine the last little bit of error correction that needs to be applied in the g-code itself. For example, it's possible to apply rotation to the g-code based on a probes results to tram (that's aligning things to the axis motion) very precisely an almost right situation.

 - Tooling Plates are typically made of either Cast Iron or Aluminum, though there are steel ones available too. They can be purchased or made from scratch. For more on how they're made, be sure to visit our Fixture Plate page.

# Modular Fixturing

 - One other thing Tooling Plates help facilitate is Modular Fixturing. Once we have a fixed grid to rely on, we can purchase ready-made fixturing components that will fit the grid. This can save quite a lot of cost versus having to fabricate everything to some custom arrangement.

# Ball Locks and Other Quick Change Tooling Plate Solutions

 - By now I hope you're seeing how much Setup Time could be saved by using Tooling Plates. What could be better? Why there are at least two different ways to improve on the theme: quick change tooling plates and pallets.

 - With a Quick Change system, the time required to deal with the dowel pins and fasteners is reduced through some kind of integrated solution that allows precise position and locking very quickly. One such is the Jergens Ball Lock system


![u112](/CIM/Notes/src/u112.png)

# Ball Locks are a Quick Release system for Tooling Plates

 - With this system, you get precise positioning and secure holding with 4 Ball Locks. Just align the plate to the sub-plate (which has the Receiver Bushings and is mounted to the table), drop the Ball Lock Shanks into the hole, twist the bolt on top of the Ball Lock Shank, and you are done. Twisting four bolts and no fooling around with dowel pins or extra fasteners is really quick and easy. Jergens talks about 30 second fixture change times which is very fast indeed.

# Pallets

 - The next step up are Pallets. Think of them as power operated Tooling Plates whereas everything else we've talked about has been hand operated. A typical machine with Pallets allows you to be setting one or more Pallets up while the machine is working on another. A Pallet change operation cycles the old Pallet outside of the machine's milling area and brings the new one in. This minimizes the time the machine has to be offline and allows Setup to be done in parallel with machining.

 - Some machines have what are called Pallet Pools, which allow multiple pallets to be set up in advance and scheduled to run. A Pallet Pool can allow a machine to run unattended for quite a long time and can be a useful building block for total automation.

 - Pallets are typically only seen on Horizontal Machining Centers and some high end Vertical Machining Centers. They're definitely a full-on production feature that is fairly expensive, so the cost has to be justified by the need ot keep the machines churning out parts constantly.4th Axis, Trunion Fixtures, Tombstones, and Tool Columns

 - Sometimes it is helpful to be able to apply another dimension to our thinking--in this case a 4th Axis. In CNC, a 4th Axis is commonly a rotary axis that is aligned to spin along an axis parallel to one of the machine's other 3 axes. On Vertical Mills, the 4th Axis is frequently parallel to X or Y, and is laid down. On a Horizontal Mill, the 4th Axis is also parallel to X or Y, but it is standing up. Both methods work great, but the horizontal mill's standing 4th axis frequently has more clearance available since the work is never trapped between the table and the axis.

 - From a Workholding standpoint, a 4th Axis can be used to bring new orientations into play for two purposes:

 1. It allows access to more sides of the part so machining can continue without having to flip parts around by hand.

 2. It allows access to more parts which may be arrayed around the 4th Axis.

 - To find out more about these uses for Work holding, check out our excellent series on 4th Axis Basics.

# Work holding Solutions

 - Having seen how we're going to position and attach our Work holding Solutions to our milling machine, let's delve into what types of Work holding are available.

# Milling Vise


![u113](/CIM/Notes/src/u113.png)

# A pair of milling vises sits side by side on a machine table

 - It's not too much of a stretch to say that the most popular Work holding Solution today is the Milling Vise. While there are many manufacturer's of such vises, the poster child is Kurt who shipped their first Kurt Vise in the 1950's.

# What Makes a Good Milling Vise?

 - A good vise is well made, typically of cast iron. It operates smoothly, repeatedly, and with a wedge mechanism that pulls the movable jaw down onto the bed so the part is not lifted due to deflection as the jaws are tightened. Don't scrimp on your milling vises because they're most likely the Work holding Solution you'll turn to most often.

# Clean the Table and Tram the Vise

 - Before putting any vise on your machine table, be sure to clean the table of chips. You don't want to trap a chip between the vise or table. If you have a T-Slot table you're mounting the vise to, you'll probably want to tram the vise as well. This is the procedure of using an indicator to sweep a vise jaw (you want the fixed jaw, not the movable jaw) so you can adjust the vise position until the sweep shows the vise jaw is parallel to the axis as it moves.Learning to tram (or square) a vise is one of those basic skills every machinist must learn early on.

# Vise Parallels and Jaw Steps

 - Having the vise properly installed and trammed, the next question is proper use. Most of the time we'll want to sit the work piece fairly high in the jaws. This is done both to provide access to the work piece and because it provides more repeatability the less of the workpiece is gripped--there's just less area for a trip or other irregularity to influence what's going on.

 - We set the work piece high in the jaws typically either by using a set of Vise Parallels or because we have jaws installed in the vise that have a step machined fairly high on the jaw. We may either machine the step ourselves (in the case of soft jaws) or purchase jaws with a step already machined.

# Clamping Outside the Jaws and Other Jaw Tricks

 - There are a lot of Vise Jaw tricks but one of the first to be aware of is that you can mount the jaws either inside or outside the normal jaw mounting locations. Mounting outside allows larger plates to be gripped in the vise easily:


![u114](/CIM/Notes/src/u114.png)

# By mounting the jaws in the outside position, quite a large workpiece can be accommodated


![u115](/CIM/Notes/src/u115.png)

# Increasing rigidity is always important. For this operation, two 2-4-6 blocks are used as a vise jaw extension to help support the plate on end better

# Using Multiple Vises, Jaws that Span Vises, and Grinding Matching

# Vises

 - There's an old saying that if you want to make full use of your machine you need to use every square inch on the table. Most machine tables can accommodate multiple vises, and it is very common to install multiple vises on a mill table. Our photo above of side by side vises shows one such setup. It's not uncommon to see four or even six vises on a larger milling machine. The more the merrier so long as travels will accommodate it because the more vises you have, the more parts you can machine before the machining has to stop so the operator can load new work pieces.

 - When you have multiple vises on a machine, it is convenient if they match in all the key dimensions to within a decent tolerance. That way if you are duplicating a setup and get the vises in a different order, all will be well. Most vise manufacturers will match vises for you or it's a fairly simple operation with a surface grinder to match a pair of vises.

 - Another trick that's possible with two vises is to use jaws that span both vises for handling really long parts:


![u117](/CIM/Notes/src/u117.png)
# Spanning two vises with a single set of jaws

# Double Milling Vise

 - Having spread three or four vises across your mill table, you've pretty well taken advantage of the X-Axis. But, there's an opportunity to take better advantage of the Y-Axis by using Double Vises:


![u118](/CIM/Notes/src/u118.png)
# A typical double station vise is like 2 vises in one

 - A typical double station vise is like 2 vises in one: you can put two work pieces instead of one. With judicious use of double vises you can really multiply the number of parts that can be worked at the same time on your mill's table.

# Vises to Hold Other Work holding Solutions

 - Between using multiple vises, double station vises, moving the jaws around, and even using jaws that span multiple vises, quite a lot is possible using just vises. In fact, you can even use the vises to hold other Work holding gadgets. It's a very common trick to drop a sine vise into a milling vise to get jaws working the other direction:


![u119](/CIM/Notes/src/u119.png)
# Use a sine vise to hold a part at 90 degrees from where the milling vise jaws run

 - You can also create small plate fixtures that are designed to sit in a vise, creating what is often called a vise pallet since the individual plate fixtures can be swapped out of the vises much like pallets.


![u120](/CIM/Notes/src/u120.png)
# Vise Pallets are just small plate fixtures designed to be held in the jaws of a milling vise

 - In general, solutions like Vise Pallets are created to enable vises to be left on the machine in shops where the flexibility and simplicity of vise work holding is ideal for most of their jobs. Soft Jaws and Custom Hard Jaws Multiply the Vise's Work holding Flexibility. Soft Jaws on milling vises are a very popular form of work holding. The idea is to create aluminum vise jaws (since aluminum is softer than ferrous materials that's where the name comes from) that are customized for particular jobs. Sometimes a more durable material is advantageous, in which case we have Hard Jaws.

# Here are some examples:


![u121](/CIM/Notes/src/u121.png)

  - Use soft jaws to locate and hold a larger round part. A V is often seen, but it won't support the part as well as the soft jaws


![u122](/CIM/Notes/src/u122.png)

  - As mentioned above, we don't want to grip the whole height of the part in the jaws. A particularly thin grip can be had with dovetail jaws. The little red circle points to the dovetail which locks the workpiece in from slipping upward under heavy machining. These are Carvesmart quick change jaws.


![u123](/CIM/Notes/src/u123.png)

  - Here's a common setup. The part is machined from a block on the left (those are the same Carvesmart dovetail jaws). Then the part is flipped in a set of custom soft jaws on the right that are the mirror image of the part. A Face mill then takes off the little bit of flat stock left from the original material (that's already happened in this photo).


![u124](/CIM/Notes/src/u124.png)

  - Lang Innovations makes these neat jaws that make it easy to set the workpiece in the vise at a precise angle when needed. The pins can be individually pushed in to create angles and other holding patterns too

# Quick Change Jaws

 - I hope you're getting the idea that Milling Vises with Custom Jaws can be a powerful workholding solution. So powerful, in fact, that a lot of work is done solely with this style of Workholding. Shops spend a lot of time creating Custom Jaws and often box them up in storage to use for other jobs or in case a customer reorders a part. Even though the vises spend most of their time on the table, we still have a Setup Time bottleneck in the time it takes to change vise jaws. Maybe you saw this coming, but there are a variety of Quick Change Vise Jaws available too. The Carvesmart jaws we pictured are one variety, but there are many more. Judicious use of an air ratchet and socket head cap screws can also speed the job of changing jaws.

# Plates, Plate Fixtures, and Clamps

 - As useful as vises are, they have a sweet spot for part size. They have a difficult time with really large plate work, though as mentioned you can move the jaws to the outside positions for medium-sized plates. And, they can also be less than optimal for very small parts. Sure, you can fit multiple parts in a set of Soft Jaws, but the space between adjacent vises and the space required for the vise mechanism makes it hard to fully fill the table with as many small parts as you might otherwise be able to.


![u125](/CIM/Notes/src/u125.png)

 - It's hard to achieve this dense packing of smaller parts with a vise, but a plate fixture makes it easy. This one uses Mitee Bite Pit Bull clamps. The effect is not unlike tiny milling vises designed to fit each part just right.

 - When its time to machine large plates or a great many small parts, it's usually time to pull the vises off the table and use a workholding solution based on clamps.

# Step Clamps

 - The most common type of clamps are called step clamps because they have little steps machined on them. They're commonly used with T-Slots, although you can also use bolt them into a Tooling Plate. Here are some typical Step Clamps:


![u126](/CIM/Notes/src/u126.png)
# Step Clamp holding down plate, step block supporting end of clamp, and bolt goes through

# T-Slot Nut


![u127](/CIM/Notes/src/u127.png)
# A typical Step Clamp Set

 - Pictured is a typical Step Clamp Set. It can be handy to stock up on a an extra set so you've got more clamping parts to work with. By stacking the Step Blocks and using longer bolts, you can clamp workpieces that are quite tall. When using step clamps, keep the bolt close to the workpiece rather than the step block. Also, it can be helpful to angle the clamp down on the part by raising it up a step or two from level. You may also want to put a shim of soft material between the clamp and the workpiece if you want to avoid marring the workpiece. Soda can makes a great shim for this purpose if you slice out some strips with your snips.

# Toe Clamps

 - Step Clamps grip the top of the workpiece, which is sometimes inconvenient because you might need to machine the area being gripped. Toe Clamps grip the side of the workpiece to give you full access to the top of the workpiece. There are a wide variety of different styles available:


![u128](/CIM/Notes/src/u128.png)

 - This toe clamp moves the clamp down a ramp when tightened to press against the workpiece


![u129](/CIM/Notes/src/u129.png)

 - Double Sided Tape, Glue, Wax, and Low Melting Point Alloys

 - Some workpieces can be very difficult to hold because they're too thin or because their shaped so there's just no way to clamp on. Some solutions for these situations are in the form of Double Sided Tape, Glue, Wax, and Low Melting Point Alloys.

 - The Glue needs to be something that will release when needed. For example, Super Glue releases at a particular temperature just like LocTite. The fumes from it are toxic, so take care to release with plenty of ventilation. Double sided tape can work great, especially for really thin materials.

 - Wax and Low Melting Point Alloys (typically Bismuth alloys) can be used to embed the workpiece and create grippable area. When the machining is done, one can melt the wax or alloy away and save for reuse.

# Vacuum Fixtures

 - Need to apply uniform pressure to hold a part down? Maybe a vacuum fixture is the answer. Sea level air pressure is 14.7 lbs per square inch. A vacuum fixture pumps a vacuum under the part so that air is pressing down on every square inch of the top with 14.7 lbs of pressure. That can create considerable holding force if there is enough surface area regardless of the shape of the top or how thin the material may be. We have a nice article on how to create your own vacuum fixtures that's very popular. For more in-depth information on vacuum workholding visit our Vacuum Table Page and our DIY Vacuum Table Page.

 - Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of vacuum fixtures is their hold-down force is limited by surface area--that means small parts can pop off relatively easily. When cutting forces exceed the hold-down force a vacuum table can pull, the part pops off and is generally ruined. This is a common problem for vacuum table users, especially for smaller parts that don't have much surface area. Until now, fixing the problem has been hit or miss, but our G-Wizard Calculator software now has the ability to limit cutting forces to what your vacuum table can handle. For more information, check out our article on this special feature.

# Chucks and Collets: For Round Parts

 - While we typically think of machining round parts on lathes, there are many times when you may need to mill them as well. If you've got a Mill-Turn machine, it may not be necessary to put them on a mill, but if you don't, or if you just need to work on some round parts on the mill, you can use the same workholding solutions Lathes use. Just bolt or clamp them down to your mill table. For example, use a 3 jaw chuck or a bank of collet chucks.

 - Lathe Chucks are particularly common on 4th Axes because we often start from round stock. Every now and then we put round parts on the mill because it's just downright faster. Consider this setup for machining round parts::


![u130](/CIM/Notes/src/u130.png)
# Expanding Mandrels, Arbors, and Studs

 - Toe Clamps are one solution to keeping the workholding away from the milling, but we can do even better using expanding mandrels, arbors, or studs. The idea is to put an expanding cylinder in a hole on the underside of the workpiece and expand it to lock the workpiece in place. Once that's done, you can access the workpiece from every direction except the bottom without encountering the workholding (do remember where the mandrels are though so you don't have one in the middle of a pocket waiting to be hit!).

 - Here is a fixture using expanding studs:


![u131](/CIM/Notes/src/u131.png)

 - Turn the bolt opens the expanding stud so it can clamp the workpiece...

 - There are a wide variety of these kinds of gizmos available for your workholding needs. They're particularly common for lathes, but as we mentioned, you can use lathe workholding all day long provided you find a way to mount it to your table.

# 5-Axis Workholding

 - 5-Axis workholding, like most things 5-axis, is a whole other world. I won't go into any detail here other than to say you need different kinds of workholding when you can access a part from virtually any direction. It becomes more challenging in this kind of workholding that the workholder not get in the way of milling the part.

# Rotary table

 - A rotary table is a precision work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head).

 - The table shown is a manually operated type. Powered tables under the control of CNC machines are now available, and provide a fourth axis to CNC milling machines. Rotary tables are made with a solid base, which has provision for clamping onto another table or fixture. The actual table is a precision-machined disc to which the work piece is clamped (T slots are generally provided for this purpose). This disc can rotate freely, for indexing, or under the control of a worm (handwheel), with the worm wheel portion being made part of the actual table. High precision tables are driven by backlash compensating duplex worms.

 - The ratio between worm and table is generally 40:1, 72:1 or 90:1 but may be any ratio that can be easily divided exactly into 360°. This is for ease of use when indexing plates are available. A graduated dial and, often, a vernier scale enable the operator to position the table, and thus the work affixed to it with great accuracy.

 - A through hole is usually machined into the table. Most commonly, this hole is machined to admit a Morse taper center or fixture.

 - Rotary tables are most commonly mounted flat, with the table rotating around a vertical axis, in the same plane as the cutter of a vertical milling machine. An alternate setup is to mount the rotary table on its end (or mount it flat on a 90° angle plate), so that it rotates about a horizontal axis. In this configuration a tailstock can also be used, thus holding the workpiece between centers.

 - With the table mounted on a secondary table, the workpiece is accurately centered on the rotary table's axis, which in turn is centered on the cutting tool's axis. All three axes are thus coaxial. From this point, the secondary table can be offset in either the X or Y direction to set the cutter the desired distance from the workpiece's center. This allows concentric machining operations on the workpiece. Placing the workpiece eccentrically a set distance from the center permits more complex curves to be cut. As with other setups on a vertical mill, the milling operation can be either drilling a series of concentric, and possibly equidistant holes, or face or end milling either circular or semicircular shapes and contours.

 - A rotary table can be used:

  - To machine spanner flats on a bolt

  - To drill equidistant holes on a circular flange

  - To cut a round piece with a protruding tang

  - To create large-diameter holes, via milling in a circular toolpath, on small milling machines that don't have the power to drive large twist drills (>0.500

  - To mill helixes

  - To cut complex curves (with proper setup)

  - to cut straight lines at any angle

  - to cut arcs

 - with the addition of a compound table on top of the rotary table, the user can move the center of rotation to anywhere on the part being cut. This enables an arc to be cut at any place on the part.

  - to cut circular pieces
